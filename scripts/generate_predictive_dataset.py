### This script is used to generate datasets for predictive modelling


# What to do:

# Get the model:
# Let the model generate samples
# Number of hypothesis
n_hypothesis = 10
# Number of references
n_references = 100

# Number of reference sets (to calculate the mean and std)

n_reference_sets = 10


#Load the config


# Get the relevant things out of the dataset.
dataset = None


# Next we the following:
# 1) generate the number of samples needed:
#
n_samples_needed = n_hypothesis + n_references * n_reference_sets

# Get the samples

# Decativate the model

# Calculate number of statistics


# Clean up (to make sure we don't run out of memory)
